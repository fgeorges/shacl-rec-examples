# SHACL REC examples

Examples from the [SHACL Recommendation](https://w3.org/TR/shacl/).

This repository contains the same content as in the REC, only extracted and
presented as separate files, which is more convenient sometimes.  Please see the
REC for details about the IP of the content.

Each directory corresponds to a section of the SHACL REC.  Each sample from that
section is a separate file in that directory (shapes, data and result samples
have been extracted.)

The directory `tools` contains some scripts.
